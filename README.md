# Equinor Drone Challenge

Welcome to the Equinor Drone Challenge! 

The _Equinor Drone Challenge_ is a drone programming task. The task is to fly a drone through a maze. 
Both the drone and the maze live in a simulated environment,
but the tools you use are the same as the tools that are being used for real-life drone development.

The challenge consists of the following tasks:
* Write a Python program to start the drone and maneuver it through the maze. Only basic Python
skills are required. Example code is provided.
* Gradually improve the program to move through the maze as fast as possible. There are several mazes and they are the same for all teams. There will be a defined starting position and a target within the maze. The goal is to move from the start position to the target as fast as possible without bumping into any obstacles.

The main goal with the challenge is to learn and have fun. But as part of the challenge, the teams will
also compete with each other in being able to fly the drone to the target as fast as possible. 
There will be a scoreboard for flight times that will be updated during the challenge.

This repository contains all you need to start working on the challenge - documentation, examples, and starter code.

__Important:__ Skills will vary. Some team members may not be comfortable with (Python) programming.
The challenge does not require that _all_ team members have programming skills, so members not very familiar with
programming can also participate and enjoy the learning and group work.
It is very important that the team includes all members in this, so no team members are left behind!

Happy flying, and remember to have fun!
